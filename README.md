## üöÄ About Me

Hello! I'm David Mugisha, a Senior Data Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable data solutions for intelligent products across aerospace, energy, and technology sectors. My passion lies in leveraging advanced analytics, cloud technologies, and artificial intelligence to solve complex business challenges and drive data-driven decision making.

## üî≠ Projects

- **Intelligent WriteBack System**: An AI-powered automated system at Collective[i] that captures and updates CRM data from emails and meetings, processing 1800+ events per day per worker and eliminating manual data entry.
- **Real-time Microservice Platform**: Built fault-tolerant systems processing 50+ messages/second with consistent updates across Salesforce and HubSpot using Kafka data pipelines.
- **Scalable Data Architectures**: Designing and implementing distributed computing systems that process 1000+ GB datasets with optimal performance.

## üå± Learning and Growth

I'm constantly exploring cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. Currently, I am diving deep into:

- **Advanced MLOps**: Enhancing machine learning model deployment and monitoring in production environments, see [marvel-characters](https://github.com/jhumigas/marvel-characters).
- **Real-time Analytics**: Mastering streaming data processing and event-driven architectures.
- **Cloud-Native Solutions**: Exploring serverless architectures (see [etl with azure functions](https://github.com/jhumigas/azfn-python-advanced-etl)) and containerized data processing on Kubernetes.
- **AI Integration**: Implementing artificial intelligence in data engineering workflows for intelligent automation.
- **Software Engineering Patterns**: Mastering craftsmanship through architectural patterns like Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, Event Sourcing, and clean architecture principles. Currently exploring advanced patterns for building maintainable, scalable systems. [Check out e-commerce-allocation!](https://github.com/jhumigas/cosmic-python-project)
